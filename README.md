# Play and Give (AKA. `scrooge`)
## An MT&L Christmas Card

In 2010, MT&L (now NATIONAL Atlantic) put together an interactive holiday card. It was a collaboration with a lot of folks including Jenn Beck (writing and scenario), Samira Saoud (illustration and design), and Paul Williams (creative direction and oversight). I did the development.

Feeling in the holiday spirit, I decided that this should live somewhere so I put it up on GitHub. Happy holidays!
